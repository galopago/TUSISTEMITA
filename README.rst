ELECTRONIC HARDWARE ROBUST PROTOTYPING SYSTEM
=======================================================================================================================================

Prototyping system based on 4 types (A,B,C,D) of simple, pre made PCB that follows some rules:

* mounting holes spacing are multiples of 10.16 mm.
* the connection between boards uses screw terminal connectors.
* uses generic, low cost, easily available waterproof enclosures
